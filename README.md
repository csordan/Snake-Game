# Snake Game 
My very first attempt of developing a game in Java 

## Inspiration
This was the final project of my introduction to programming class at Emory University. I thought that developing a game would be a fun and easy (so I thought) way to use all the skills I gained from this course to create a fully functional game. Having played the game of Snake all semester when I did not want to pay attention in lecture, I figured implementing the classic game of Snake in java would be a good project to end the semester. 

## What it does
This game is my own rendition of the arcade game, Snake, originally known as Blockade. Instead of the classic game of snake, in which the objective is to eat the most blocks to get the longest snake as possible, my version implements a level system. In each increasing level, the layout of the map changes with different obstacles and the speed of the snake increases. I have yet to find someone that has been able to successfully complete all 10 levels so please let me know if you are able to do so. Send me a screenshot of the completion message and a picture of your face and I will have it framed in my apartment forever. 


## How I built it
A lot youtube and Googling. Also, I would like to thank my proffessor, Dr. Oser, for always being there for me during office hours. Without him, I probably would have never gotten this game to work and probably would have switched majors. 




## Challenges I ran into



There were two ways we thought of implementing our idea. So we could either take the youtube links and find lyrics that match the song from a song database or we could use text-to-speech input to output the lyrics. We had trouble matching the timing of the lyrics to the song. Our audio filtering was inconsistent, depending on the composition of the song the success of our filtering varied. We decided to write the API calls with javascript but I was unfamiliar with javascript so I spent a lot of time figuring out how to translate java code into javascript. We also had design conflicts in choosing between a moving, flashy background or a static, simple background. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We gained vital exposure in javascript, a language that we all for the most part were novices in. We learned about UI/UX from our team leader, Dave. We had a working program that muted the vocals of a song, allowing the users to use their voices. We made progress finding a way to match vocals with the lyrics within our time frame.  For many of us, it was our first hackathon. Thus, it was rewarding to see our product at the end of the day.

## What I learned
I learned some javascript and how API calls are made with javascript. From a design standpoint I also learned the importance of the flow of the user interface. From a team standpoint we learned how to manage our time and set incremental goals to meet for our project. We learned about the six step SPRINT method( understand, define, diverge, decide,prototype) that was used as an outline for our project. We learned have to use Node.js

## What's next for Snake
The sky is the limit
